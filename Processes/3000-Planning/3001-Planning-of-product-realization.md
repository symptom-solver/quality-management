# 3001 - Planning of product realization

## Process description
This process descripes how the 'Symptom Solver' software group realizes new products. The CEO will start with a market analysis. The analysis is mandatory to determine what the customer base is, what needs the product must fulfill and what the commercial aspects are. If the product has a customer base and is feasible a 'Product realization team' will further work on the product.

If you are part of the 'Product realization team', the next step is to define what intended use the product has and how it should be used. In the same instance all other not intended use-cases will be recorded.
After those steps, the information is used to define how the group can access and communicate with the customer base. Half of the 'Product realization team' will now start actively communicating with the customer base in order to aquire new customers and to further collect information about what the customers expect and wish for. This can be done by designing advertising strategies, creating surveys or get feedback from specific suited insitutions or locations, e.g. hospitals, medical practices.Further explained in '3002 - Getting Customer Feedback' 

To other half will start working on the production plan of the product.
