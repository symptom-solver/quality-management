# 2001 - Staff Qualification established

## Process description
This process describes how the 'Symptom Solver' software group ensures that the staff is adequately qualified before hiring.

Phase 1: Initial
To establish the qualification of a new member you must collect his resume. If the resume hints that the appliciant is suited you can invite him to an interview. Ask him relevant questions about his experience and skill set and document everything. If everything about the new appliciant is good and he seems to fit into the overall group culture, report back to the CEO with the report and the notice to start a trial period. If not report back to the CEO with the notice to reject the new appliciant.

Phase 2: Trial Period
If you are assigned, to access the qualities of a new appliciant in his trial period, you should introduce him to his new environment with detailed description of what and how to do, which is all decided by you. On your own judgment decide what possible task the new appliciant can already perform. Let the new appliciant write down his approach. If the new appliciant seems to perform well you can integrate him into the normal work flow. Always check his "approach-report" and his finished product. The "approach-report" can be dismissed if the appliciant presents good results. The trial period normally takes 3 months, after half a month report back to the CEO with a report on the new appliciant. With good results the trial period can be shortened. With bad results you or the CEO will search the conversation with the new appliciant on possible problems. After the trial periods ends again report to the CEO and decide to offer a contract or reject the applicant. 

Before the new appliciant is accepted he must take the Test descriped in Process "2002 - Staff qualification checked"
