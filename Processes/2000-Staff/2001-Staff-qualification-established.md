# 2001 - Staff Qualification established

## Process description
This process describes how the 'Change later' software group ensures that the staff is adequately qualified. To ensure this new members must run through an interview process. First all technical information about the new members is collected via a submitted resume. The CEO will assign three different current members of the group that will check if the new members on paper are adequately qualified. If the new members are qualified enough they start a trial period of three months. In those three months a current member of the group is advised as supervisor by the CEO for the new members. The supervisor helps the new members understand the current line of production, their respective work and how to perform their job. After the trial period ends the supervisor must write a detailed record of what the new members did, how they performed and give and a suggestion whether the new members are qualified practically or not. If the supervisor suggests to keep the new members an audit of three current members as well as the CEO must proofread the record. In an uniform voting all attendees (Supervisor, three current members and CEO) must vote to keep the new members. Every new member is labeled as 'qualified member'.
