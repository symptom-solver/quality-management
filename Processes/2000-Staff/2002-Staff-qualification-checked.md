## Process description
This process describes how the 'Symptom Solver' Software group ensures that the staff is adquately qualified. To do this each department has one or more supervisors. Qualified as supervisors is everyone that has been accepted and assigned to this position by the CEO. At the end of each quarter the supervisors will either create himself or hire someone, that checks the qualification of all employees in his department as well as further educates all and informs them about new updates in the corresponding department and field of knowledge.
This process is finished once all employees have taken the small test after the further training.

The department supervisor is also responsible for all his employees, therefore if one of the employees fails the further training test, can't deliver the workload assinged to him or disrupts the corporate culture it's in his responsibility to search the conversation.
As department supervisor you must always take notes when searching the conversation with an employee and keep them stored. Ask politly for the reasons why the employee can't deliver and judge the situation accordingly. If you need further help report back to your superior or the CEO
