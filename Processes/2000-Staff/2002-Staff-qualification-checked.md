# 2002 - Staff qualification checked

## Process description
This process describes how the 'Change later' Software group ensures that the staff is adquately qualified. To do this each department has one or more supervisors. Qualified as supervisors is everyone that has been accepted by the CEO. At the end of each quarter the supervisors will write a record for their department. If anyone can't fulfill their workload or attracted concerning attention the coresponding supervisor will also write a record for this specific member. Those members will be labeled as 'concerning members'. The CEO will read all the records. The CEO and the supervisors will meet at the beginning of each quarter to decide how to continue with members of the group that can't fulfill their workload or attracted concerning attention. Every other member is judged as adequately qualified and will be labeled as 'qualified member'.
