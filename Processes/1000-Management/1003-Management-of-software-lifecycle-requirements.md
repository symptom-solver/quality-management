# Management of Software Lifecycle Requirements

## Process description
This process descripes how the functional and non-functional requirements of the software lifecycle can be adapted over time in the "Symptom Solver" Software Group.

If you want to include, exclude or combine any functional or non-functional requirements to the software lifecycle, you first must write out a detailed description why this step is necessary. This should be later committed to the GIT via the commit message. In this instance you should check if there is any way to rather extend a requirement instead of creating a new requirement. Also, if you are deleting a requirement, you have to check that no other requirement is build upon the requirement you are trying to delete.
To create a new requirement copy the existing software development plan and insert, extend or delete a requirement. Once done create a new branch and commit the updated software development plan with the detailed description in the commit message. To successfully finish the task, you should create a pull request.

The process is successfully finished, once the CEO confirmed or declined the pull request and a merge happened.
