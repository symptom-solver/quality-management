# 1002 - Management review of the quality management system documents

## Process description
This process describes how the management of the 'Symptom Solver' software group reviews the quality management system. The purpose of this process is to ensure that newly created or updated documents are reviewed by the management team before they are merged into the master branch of the GIT repository. The management team consists of the CEO and the leadership board of the 'Symptom Solver' software group. Only perform this task if you are part of the management team or are trusted with this task by the management team.

To check a document's quality one has to check:
* Document is complete, no fields are left out
* Document is up to date
* Document follows naming conventions
* Document is without inconsistencies or errors
* Document is in line with the company's quality policy (ISO 13485)
* Document or commit message states a clear reason, why the document is needed

Only if all boxes can be checked the document will be merged into the master branch. If anything is missing provide feedback to the author of the new or changed document. If you find, that instead of creating a new document an existing one could be updated or expanded, write also back to the author.
